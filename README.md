simple web app for fantasy premier league

Funny story...

My friends and I compete on who will have the most points on each gameweek for English Premier Fantasy League,
we buy the winner internet bundles and loser is the one who gets to buy the winner bundles...

The way the FPL App is structured doesn't display the rank for the winner of the gameweek for private leagues...

So I made a simple web app that utilizes the FPL API to give me data for any private league in the FPL and displays the
overall winner of the current gameweek and displays it...

It's currently a work in progress but its progressing well...
The problem I have at the moment is that most browsers have Access Origin Policy which blocks the app from fetching data
in the API...

Since im still building it im using a CORS Block in browser to test it functionality...

Its purely HTML,CSS and JavaScript...


For server side python3 to start the http rendering to test the web app
($ python3 -m http.server -d ./simple-spa-fpl 5050)
